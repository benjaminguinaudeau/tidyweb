# Tidyweb

This package is meant to ease web scraping with Selenium by "tidying" the html structure. To do so, it iterates recursively on web elements until a given depth and returns a tibble, with the children elements nested in list-columns. That way, tidy principles can be used to identify specific elements and eventually interact with them.
